## Urban Fractions

This folder houses urban population fractions from DHS sampling frames. Typically this comes from table A1 in DHS reports. More details can be found here: <https://github.com/wu-thomas/SUMMER-DHS/tree/main/Vignette/Urban%20Fraction>.

Files are named after country and the year the sampling frame comes from (e.g. census year).
